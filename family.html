<p>	I am the youngest of two kids in my family. I have a 24 year old sister named Rachael and she lives in Marlborough Massachusetts. She works at a store in Natick Massachusetts called Tiles plus More, where she helps people design tiling in their bathrooms and kitchens. She attended Wentworth Institue for interior design. My sister and I are really close, we call each other about once a week just to catch each other up on our daily lives and whats been going on. My father's name is Bruce, he is an engineer, he attended the University of Massachusetts Lowell. He is now the director of Manufacturing at HTP. My dad is the person who influenced and began my love for baseball when he signed me up at the age of 5. I've taken him to many red sox games so that we can share our love for the sport together. My mother's name is Rhonda, she owns a fitness company called Paleo2Go, which helps people to track and maintain their fitness and get into better shape. She also teaches exercise classes at a gym. Both of my parents are into crossfit, which is how I got the job teaching and coaching children in the summer of 2015. I myself did crossfit for a little while, but it interfered with other commitments. My family is really close, we spend a lot of time together and we love to play card games at family functions. We are a very competitive family, so poker games can get pretty intense.
