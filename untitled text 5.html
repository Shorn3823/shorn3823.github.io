<p>	I also have a passion for sports, most notably baseball as I have played it for over 13 years. I was the captain as a senior for my final year of highschool baseball. I played pitcher as well as third base while hitting second in my team's batting order. The interesting part about my positions is that there is a need for a strong arm or usually a larger body, which doesn't normally come with my size. My dad first convinced me to start playing baseball so young by taking me to a store and letting me buy one item of my choice, I chose a product named “Mighty Beanz”. </p>

<p> When I first moved on Cape my dad signed me up for a new traveling baseball team. When I finally showed up we found out that it was wooden bats only. A few weeks and tryouts pass by and I learned I made the team. Then after the first couple practices and talking with other players around the cape I realized that the team I made, The Dugout Dawgs, was the best organization on Cape Cod. Here I learned from a few of the best coaches I've ever had, Coach Dave Iava, Coach Ryan Kinski, and Coach Mike Kennedy.
