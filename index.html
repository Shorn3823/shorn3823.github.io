<H1>Steven Horn</H1>
<IMG  SRC="G0099592.jpg" width="200">
<P>My full name is Steven Michael Horn, which I share my first name with my mother's youngest brother and my middle name with her oldest brother. I am eighteen years old as of May fifth and am the youngest of my immediate family with a sister who is six years older than me. I was born in Worcester Massachusetts but lived in Marlborough Massachusetts for 14 years. For the past four years I lived on Cape Cod where I attended Sturgis Charter Public School studying the International Baccalaureate program. The IB program is regarded as one of the most (if not the most) rigorous curriculum offered by high schools. I enrolled in the highest level of business that was offered for the longest amount of time I could take it for where I was awarded with the effort award every year that I was eligible. I won the class superlative of “Most School Spirited” as I “took spirit week too seriously” as well as attempted to attend every sporting event possible. Sturgis was a small school with a total of less than five hundred students, so I was able to get to know every member of my graduating class, which gave me the experience to be able to communicate and understand different types of people.
</P>
	<P>For a year and a half I worked at a Dunkin’ Donuts near my house, where I got the promotion of “shift leader”. A year and a half may not seem like a long time but, at a place that has such a high labor turnover rate, I left as the person who's been there the second longest. That includes the fact that I outlasted three of my stores managers and worked more hours than one of them as a minor. During my first semester I was working thirty hour weeks while also balancing the demands of my school. However because of this commitment, I feel as though it improved my work ethic and also gave me an understanding about business that I was able to incorporate into my classes. However during the spring I only worked weekends as I had a commitment to my last full year of baseball.
	 </p>
	<p>I also have a passion for sports, most notably baseball as I have played it for over 13 years. I was the captain as a senior for my final year of highschool baseball. I played pitcher as well as third base while hitting second in my team's batting order. The interesting part about my positions is that there is a need for a strong arm or usually a larger body, which doesn't normally come with my size. My dad first convinced me to start playing baseball so young by taking me to a store and letting me buy one item of my choice, I chose a product named “Mighty Beanz”.

	<P> For my last summer before heading off to college I did everything I possibly could to make it as enjoyable as possible. For example with my family I traveled to even more northern Maine to go white water rafting on the Penobscot River. I also spent a total of 6 sitting hours to be able to carry around a part of my family permanently. And finally I took my girlfriend to jump 12,000 feet out of the sky. All this just to attempt to make the most of my summer.
	 </p>
	<p>  Now the reasons I’ve come to Maine are that I used to have family connections in East Boothbay Harbor, which I have since gotten tattooed on my left shoulder blade, the University poses a solid financial out of state option, and it ranked in the top twelve for business schools.
