<body> 
<p>	 I moved to Sandwich the summer before my freshman year so that I could attend Sturgis Charter Public school. This school offers the IB (International Baccalaureate) which is renown as the most rigorous highschool program. The IB program offers college level courses to juniors ands seniors so that they are better prepared for college. At the end of senior year, there are tests in each course that you take, that are cumulative to what was learned from the beginning of junior year to the end of senior year. If students score well enough to earn a total of 24 or more marks, they will receive an "International Baccalaureate" diploma, which is a second diploma from a regular high school diploma.   </p>

<p>	During my junior and senior years, I took HL (higher level, the highest level offered) Business, SL (standard level, less rigorous but still college level) english, math, spanish, history and environmental science. I feel as though taking these taking these classes prepared me well for the transition from high school to college.
