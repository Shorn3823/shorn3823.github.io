<body> 
<p>	 The summer of 2017 is when I got my first tattoo. I went to a store in Plymouth Massachusetts named Cobra Custom Tattoo and got it by an artist named Midas. The atmosphere in the shop is second to none. Each tattoo artist is friendly and willing to make sure you leave with the tattoo of your dreams. I sat for a total of 5 1/2 hours and could not be happier about the result. One of the first things you see when you walk in is a sign that says "a good tattoo ain't cheep, and a cheep tattoo ain't good" and the $ 660 dollars I spent (including tip) proved it. </p>

<p>	The tattoo itself has very sentimental meaning to me personally. The piece is a landscape piece of the marina that my grandfather build in Boothbay Harbor Maine. Not only is it a sediment to him since he passed away when I was 13, but it is also a testament as not only did he build it as his business but it was also his home. He was an inspiration to me and my family and I couldn't be happier that I have a piece of him premaritally on me.
